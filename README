This small JavaScript library is an easy way to manage a queue of items you are playing.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var player = Phonograph.create();
	
	var tracks = [ 'http://some.mp3', 'http://some-other.mp3' ];
	player.trackChanged(function() {
		alert("We're now playing a new track!");
	});
	player.play(tracks);
</script>
