This small coffeescript/javascript library is an easy way to manage a queue of items you are playing.

<audio id="my-player"/>

<script type="text/javascript">
	elem = document.getElementById("my-player");
	player = new Phonograph(elem);
	
	tracks = [ 'http://some.mp3', 'http://some-other.mp3' ];
	player.trackChanged(function() {
		alert("We're now playing a new track!");
	});
	player.play(tracks);
</script>
